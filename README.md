# Weather API

Weather API is a Node.js application that combines information from two different APIs, [Musement](https://api-docs.musement.com/) for cities and [WeatherApi](https://www.weatherapi.com/) for weather information, providing the weather information for each city where Musement has activities to sell.
The information can be obtained by calling an API route or by running a script from the command line interface (CLI).

## About The Project

The application could be run directly using package scripts or using Docker container

### Structure

The project root is under `/src` folder and the target for built application is `/dist` folder.
The content of `/src` is divided under that criteria, `/app` contains the structure of the application that provide an Express server to serve the API.
The `/cli` folder contains all script that could be executed outside the application directly in Command Line Interface (CLI).
The common libraries are under `/lib` folder, and obviously the folder `/test` is used to perform unit and integration tests.

### Built With

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Getting Started

You can run the project directly or better under docker container.

### Prerequisites

Obviously Node and npm installation is mandatory, the project use the LTS version 14.17.3 and npm version 7.20.1, check if Node is rightly installed, it could be useful use NVM to guarantee the use of the right version of Node and avoid issues dues to the use of a different version.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zauker/wheater-api.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Set Environment

   Before run the project you have to set the environment vars.
   The base URL of the APIs are without protocol, ideally you could use a different protocol (http/https), when the protocol is not specified https will be used.
   For weather API you have to set a key too.

   The API route could perform a call to a limit number of cities, or for a certain number of a forecast days, language could be setted too (so the name of cities and weather condition descriptions will be served in the required language).

   The values setted in env vars is used as default setting and used if any params are passed with the call.

   These value is used also to perform test, if necessary we could set a different environment set for test purpose.

   PORT is the port number of the express server, EXPOSE_PORT is the port mapped on it on Docker container.

   ```.env
   MUSEMENT_API_BASE_URL=sandbox.musement.com/api/v3/
   WEATHER_API_BASE_URL=api.weatherapi.com/v1/
   WEATHER_API_AUTH_KEY=**your-key-here**

   DEFAULT_CITY_LIMIT=
   DEFAULT_FORECAST_DAYS=2
   DEFAULT_LANG=en

   PORT=3000
   EXPOSE_PORT=3000
   ```

## Usage

### local run

You can run the application locally without using Docker. This is an overview of command setted in script section of package.json.

* __lint__ : run linter for code analysis
* __test__ : perform tests
* __coverage__ : perform tests and check the coverage of testing code
* __build__ : build the source typescript code to javascript
* __dev__ : run the application in development mode, the code in src folder are in watch and app restart when updates occurred.
* __start__ : run the built application

So you can start the application run the command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

or the following

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Docker run

For Docker we use docker-compose that set one container called `weather-api`.

We have to different setting for Dev and Prod environment.

Docker build use the `.env` variables for building the container, in this step only `PORT` and `EXPOSE_PORT` are used. The other environment variables are setted inside the container.
You could override the value of env vars setted in the container using specific .env files.

* __.env.dev__ : is used in development configuration
* __.env.prod__ : is used in production configuration

Build dev

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml build 
```

Run dev

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Build prod

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml build 
```

Run prod

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

The Development container run the command `npm run dev` so the application start in watch mode. The Production container run the `npm run start` the container has not src and test folder and dev-dependencies installed.

## CLI reference

The CLI command return only a text/plain response in console log.

It doesn't handle argvs but it take the setted default value of limit, days and lang from ENV setting.

Run as develop mode (right from TS)

```sh
nodemon -r tsconfig-paths/register src/cli/forecast.ts
```

Run from built (using node)

```sh
node dist/cli/forecast.js
```

Override .env setting

```sh
DEFAULT_CITY_LIMIT=5 nodemon -r tsconfig-paths/register src/cli/forecast.ts
```

or

```sh
DEFAULT_CITY_LIMIT=5 node dist/cli/forecast.js
```

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/zauker/wheater-api/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

Add params validator with Express Validator.

Add argvs handling in CLI script.

Localize also the statement `Processed city` on responses.

We should consider to introduce a Redis caching system to reduce the use of external API, it improves the performance and might be useful in case of API with a free tier quota or pay per use formula.

We should consider to introduce a mock server for testing external API, in this way test are faster and API doesn't consume the free tier quota for testing.
